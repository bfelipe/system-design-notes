# Batch

The Batch processing model is another technique to process high volume of data in chunks in a scalable manner. This technique involves executing a series of jobs/tasks without manual triggering, usually started by programmed intervals or triggered by specific events.
Batch jobs may depend on each other or external events which will require careful orchestration to maintain proper execution order. Also, batch processing systems usually have fault tolerance mechanisms to handle errors or failures.
