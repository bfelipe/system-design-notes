# DNS (Domain Name System)

Imagine a phone agenda, where you can find easily the phone number for each of your contacts.
That is what can be said about DNS.
A DNS is a system that mach each domain name (web site) to a specific IP address. When you type in your device www.somewhere.com basically look into its massive list and route your request to that IP which was registered alongside that domain name.

## Name Registrars

When you decided to register your domain name (web site link) in the internet, you first have to link it into an static IP as we discussed early. This is done by a Name Registrars. They are certifierd vendors of domain names and are responsible to deal with all burocracy of linking that domain name to a given IP, this is called DNS Records, a document that everytime a client hits a link, this record will return the IP addresss that will direct the client to the right server.
But not everyone can do that. Name Registrars operates over the shadow of a big company called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). They are responsible to maintaing the records of domain names and IPs and some other procedures related to the register coordination of the domain registrars.
Some known Name Registrars: GoDaddy, Google Domains, HostGator.
